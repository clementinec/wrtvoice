Existing evaluations typically focus on single metrics (energy or comfort) in isolated climates, neglecting metric interdependencies, seasonal mechanisms, and non-stationary climate forcing. We address these gaps through comprehensive co- simulation of four control strategies—Reference rule-based control (RBC), PMV-based, Physics-Informed Neural Network Variational Autoencoder (PINN-VAE), and LightGBM—across five climate zones (ASHRAE 2A–6A: Miami, Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, Brussels, Stockholm) and three time horizons (Historical 2001–2020, Midterm 2041–2060, Longterm 2081–2100) under RCP8.5 climate scenarios. Using EnergyPlus annual simulations at 15-minute resolution, we evaluate eight performance dimensions: total energy use intensity (EUI), peak demand, thermal comfortunder three metrics (EnergyPlus 24/7 discomfort, PMV violations, Adaptive-80% exceedance), load factor, and control ramping. Results reveal fundamental metric-objective mismatches: PINN-VAE and LightGBM, trained on occupant-reported thermal sensation votes (TSV), achieve 8–11% EUI savings and 18–30% tariff-window peak reductions in cooling-dominated climates (zones 2A–3B) with <10% Adaptive discomfort, yet exhibit 76–91% PMV violations due to adaptive behavior absent in Fanger’s steady-state model. Conversely, PMV-based control maintains <20% PMV discomfort but forgoes energy benefits (<2% savings). Critically, while predictive controllers achieve 7–11% EUI savings even in heating-dominated climates (zone 6A) via substantial heating reductions, they create synchronized morning recovery peaks (+25% vs. Reference), posing grid management challenges despite energy benefits. Controller rankings remain stable across time horizons despite +1–3% EUI increases from climate change, indicating robustness to mid-century warming. Comfort-efficiency trade-off analysis identifies Pareto-optimal deployment strategies: LightGBM for maximum energy/cost reduction in warm climates, PINN-VAE for balanced performance, PMV for comfort- critical applications. Ramp rate reductions (30–50% vs. Reference in cooling climates)demonstrate grid-friendliness, though fleet-scale synchronization risks require aggregator-level coordination. We provide climate-specific controller suitability profiles and multi-metric evaluation protocols to guide building operators, policymakers, and researchers in selecting ML/DL strategies aligned with stakeholder priorities and regional climate trajectories. Our findings underscore that metric choice fundamentally alters controller rankings, necessitating transparent multi-objective reporting for equitable performance assessment.
