ESSAY CONTEXT (First 500 words):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
i) Research Context Thermal comfort modeling fundamentally relies on thermal sensation votes - discrete ordinal ratings from -3 (cold) to +3 (hot). Yet current approaches misalign with this ordered structure by treating votes as dis- crete nominal classiﬁcation or continuous regression targets or nominal classiﬁcations. This proposal fun- damentally reexamines the nature of this relationship, ﬂipping the conventional approach from predicting single thermal sensation point estimates to predicting calibrated probability distributions over all thermal sensation vote categories. Unlike nominal classiﬁers or numeric regressors, ordinal models explicitly en- code the ordered nature of TSV via thresholded latent scales (cumulative-link / proportional-odds) [1, 2]. And because building control chooses among actions under uncertainty, we require calibrated class prob- abilities (not just point predictions), so that acceptability, conﬁdence, and tail-risk can be computed with decision-theoretic validity [3, 4, 5]. This proposal does not simply substitute one statistical model for another. It reframes the object of inference itself: from single-point TSV labels to calibrated probability distributions that directly quantify acceptability, conﬁdence, and tail risk for operational control. a) From deterministic indices to data-driven comfort modeling Thermal comfort modeling has evolved through three distinct phases, each addressing limitations of its predecessors while introducing new challenges for building control applications as outlined in Figure 2. Deterministic foundations and ﬁeld limitations. Fanger’s PMV/PPD model [6] established the analyt- ical foundation by balancing metabolic heat production against environmental losses to predict group- average sensation and dissatisfaction. Codiﬁed in ISO 7730 [7] and ASHRAE 55 [8], these indices dominate design compliance and benchmarking. However, decades of ﬁeld application revealed criti- cal fragilities: PMV predictions are sensitive to uncertain inputs—notably mean radiant temperature and metabolic rate—and shortcut practices such as assuming MRT →air temperature introduce systematic errors in comfort indices and control decisions [9, 10]. Adaptive comfort and contextual variation. Large-scale ﬁeld studies by de Dear & Brager [11] and Nicol & Humphreys [12] demonstrated that occupants adapt expectations to outdoor conditions and build- ing operation, producing comfort temperature drifts and broadened acceptability in naturally ventilated buildings. This adaptive perspective, now incorporated into standards as an alternative compliance path, reveals the importance of contextual factors (climate, operation mode, culture) that deterministic models struggle to capture systematically. Machine learning and data quality challenges. The availability of large thermal comfort databases: ASHRAE Global II [13] and Chinese datasets [14]—has catalyzed machine learning studies exploring per- sonalization across climates and building types [15, 16]. However, data heterogeneity in instrumentation and protocols, missing personal variables, and systematic measurement shortcuts (e.g., MRT assumptions) create generalization challenges where naive ML may overﬁt artifacts rather than genuine physiological responses [9, 17]. Most ML studies report top-1 accuracy or MSE, but control-relevant use hinges on well-calibrated probabilities and order-aware evaluation, not nominal accuracy alone [3, 4]. b) Current challenges in comfort modeling and control Three fundamental challenges limit the application of thermal comfort models to building control: mea- surement heterogeneity, missing contextual stratiﬁcation, and the mismatch between ordinal sensation scales and control requirements. We saw these challenges ﬁrst-hand

[18:43:46] BOT:
Dear student,

I've had the opportunity to review your essay and am excited to dive deeper into your arguments. To get started, could you please briefly summarize the main thesis of your proposal in your own words? What is the core argument you're making about thermal comfort modeling, and how does it aim to address current challenges in the field?

[18:43:56] STUDENT:
I don't know what you want me to say. I'm just...

[18:44:00] BOT:
I see some frustration, but let's unpack it together! You've written a compelling essay, and now we're diving deeper.

Before we proceed, can you tell me what specifically makes you uncertain or unclear about the main thesis of your proposal? Is it the methodology, the argument itself, or something else?

[18:44:14] STUDENT:
What is more normal I guess that really bugs me a lot

[18:44:16] BOT:
I sense some unease and frustration. Can you help me understand what specifically bothers you about the concept of "normal" in this context? Are you concerned that your proposal might be perceived as challenging established norms, or do you worry that it won't account for the variability of human comfort experiences? What is it about "normal" that's causing concern?

[18:44:23] STUDENT:
Sorry, I meant novel.

[18:44:25] BOT:
I think we've made some progress! You've switched from "novel" to "normal", but the underlying question remains. What precisely is your concern about how others might perceive or interpret your proposal? Are you worried that they might view it as disrupting established practices, or do you fear that its novelty might be misunderstood or underappreciated in the field of thermal comfort modeling?

[18:44:27] STUDENT:
What is more novel?

[18:44:30] BOT:
It seems we've taken a step back. Let's gently refocus on your concern. You initially mentioned frustration with something, then shifted to "novel", and now are inquiring about what's more novel. I'm here to help you clarify your thoughts.

Can you tell me, how does the concept of novelty relate to the core argument or contribution of your proposal? What specifically do you mean by "what is more novel"? Is it a question about the uniqueness of your approach, or perhaps something else entirely?

[18:44:38] STUDENT:
I don't think our counter is working properly.

[18:44:41] BOT:
It seems we've veered off track again. Let's get back to the topic at hand. Earlier, you mentioned frustration with something and then shifted to "novel." Now, it appears we're discussing a different issue altogether - the functionality of a counter.

Before we investigate that further, I'd like to gently steer us back on course. You initially proposed reexamining the nature of thermal sensation votes and their relationship with building control. To strengthen your argument, could you clarify how the concept of novelty relates to this core proposal? What specific aspect or contribution do you believe is particularly novel in your approach?
