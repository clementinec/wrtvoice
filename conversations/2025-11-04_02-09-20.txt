ESSAY CONTEXT (First 500 words):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Department of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong Knowles Building, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR November 2, 2025 Editor-in-Chief (or Handling Editor) Energy Dear Editors, Please find enclosed our manuscript entitledFuture-weather benchmarking of building con- trollers: energy, peaks and comfort across five climatesfor consideration inEnergy. The paper presents a multi-city, multi-horizon benchmark of machine- and deep-learning HVAC con- trollers under future-weather inputs, jointly evaluatingenergy use,tariff-window peak demand (14:00–20:00), andthermal comfort. The study is controller-agnostic and quantifies grid-relevant impacts (peaks, ramps) alongside standard building metrics, aligning withEnergy’s readership at the building–grid interface. What is new and important.Across five representative climates and three horizons (Historical, Midterm, Longterm), the proposed controllers reduce site EUI by8–11%in cooling-dominant cities and lower tariff-window peak demand by18–30%via pre-cooling. In heating-dominant sites, morning recovery can increase by∼25%, a planning consideration we quantify. Rankings remain stable under a moderate-emissions pathway (RCP4.5 vs. RCP8.5: identical in 57/60 city– horizon cases), indicating pathway-robust guidance. Using representative tariffs (energy$0.08– 0.35/kWh; demand$10–30/kW·month), the Miami reference case converts the reported energy (−6.3 kWh m−2yr−1) and demand-window (−1.8 kW) reductions into roughly$1.0–$3.6 m−2yr−1, illustrating economic significance. Fit forEnergy.The manuscript contributes (i) grid-relevant demand metrics tied to controller policies, (ii) a transparent, reproducible pipeline for future-weather benchmarking, and (iii) deploy- ment guidance that differentiates cooling- vs. heating-dominant sites. We believe it will interest readers working on energy systems integration, building demand flexibility, and planning under climate change. Compliance.This manuscript is original, has not been published previously, and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors approve its submission toEnergy. Data, code, trained weights, and weather files will be released publicly upon acceptance and are available to reviewers on request. Suggested subject areas (non-binding).Energy systems analysis; Demand response and flex- ibility; Energy efficiency in buildings; Future energy scenarios. Thank you for your consideration. I would be happy to address any questions that may arise during review. Sincerely, Hongshan Guo, Ph.D. Assistant Professor Department of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong hongshan@hku.hk 2

CONVERSATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[02:09:23] BOT:
Dear Hongshan,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to Energy. I have begun reviewing it, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the research. Could you please take a moment to distill your main thesis or central argument in your own words? How would you summarize the core contribution of this paper to our readers?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

[02:09:45] STUDENT:
Read it yourself.

[02:09:49] BOT:
A bold response! It sounds like you're confident that your manuscript speaks for itself. But, as a reader, I'm not yet convinced of its significance. Can you tell me what specifically makes this paper a "core contribution" to our readers in Energy? What's the main takeaway that will make them care about your results and methodological approach?

(Note: I'm not asking you to repeat the abstract or summary; I want you to distill it down to the essence of your argument.)

[02:09:53] STUDENT:
about

[02:09:55] BOT:
A brief but intriguing answer! You say "about", which implies that there is indeed a significant contribution worth making. However, I'm still unclear on what exactly that contribution is.

Can you help me out by elaborating on what specific aspect of your research will have readers of Energy nodding their heads in agreement and thinking, "Ah, yes, this changes my perspective on..."? What's the key takeaway that resonates with our audience?

[02:09:55] STUDENT:
Don't slide your confidence at your right.

[02:09:58] BOT:
A clever phrase! I think you're trying to deflect or redirect my question. However, I'm not asking about the abstract or a summary, but rather what specific aspect of your research will resonate with our readers in Energy.

Let's take another look at the phrase "Don't slide your confidence at your right." Is this a reference to the direction or focus of your argument? If so, what specifically do you mean by it?

Can you help me understand how this phrase relates to the main contribution of your paper and why it will be of interest to our readers in Energy?

[02:09:59] STUDENT:
The video script sticks for itself.

[02:10:02] BOT:
A new attempt at evasion! You're trying to sidestep the question again. I'm not asking about a video, by the way - we were discussing your manuscript in Energy.

Let me try to help you out. When you said "The video script sticks for itself," it sounds like you're implying that the content of your paper is self-explanatory and doesn't need further explanation. But, as I've been trying to get at, what's the core message or contribution that readers will care about?

Can you try to distill down the essence of your argument into a single sentence? What's the main takeaway that you hope readers will grasp from your paper?

[02:10:03] STUDENT:
I think

[02:10:06] BOT:
A tentative start! "I think" is an interesting way to phrase it, as it implies uncertainty rather than confidence. Let me press a bit further.

If you're unsure about the main takeaway or contribution of your paper, how can you be certain that readers will find it compelling? What specific evidence or findings do you have that suggest your research will resonate with our audience in Energy?

In other words, what makes you think (no pun intended) that your study on future-weather benchmarking of building controllers has a significant contribution to make in this field?

[02:10:06] STUDENT:
or trying to deflect or...

[02:10:08] BOT:
It seems we're back to the dance of evasion again! I'm not asking about your intentions, but rather what you're trying to convey. When you say "or trying to deflect or...", it sounds like a sentence fragment without a clear direction.

Can you try to complete that thought? What were you attempting to communicate with this phrase?

[02:10:11] STUDENT:
It seems we're back to the tussle.

[02:10:13] BOT:
A clever play on words, but let's get back to substance! You said "It seems we're back to the tussle," which implies that you're acknowledging a pattern or cycle. Can you clarify what this "tussle" refers to? Is it a particular challenge or debate in your field of study that your paper is trying to address, or something else entirely?

[02:10:15] STUDENT:
address Clancy aunt

[02:10:18] BOT:
It seems we've taken a detour from the conversation! I'd love to gently steer us back on track.

You started to respond with "or trying to deflect or...", but it seemed to trail off. Now, you're saying "address Clancy aunt." Could you clarify what you meant by these words? Are they related to your research, or is there something else at play here?

Let's try to reconnect the conversation. You were discussing how your paper on future-weather benchmarking of building controllers might resonate with our audience in Energy. What specific insights or findings from your study do you believe would be particularly relevant or valuable for readers in this field?

[02:10:19] STUDENT:
I'm asking about your clever play on words. But let's get back to s***.

[02:10:22] BOT:
I see we're still navigating the conversation! You seem to be referring to my earlier phrase, "It seems we're back to the dance of evasion again." However, you've introduced a new twist with your current statement.

Can you clarify what you mean by "your clever play on words"? Are you acknowledging that I made a witty remark, or are you using this phrase as a way to sidestep the original question? What specific aspect of our conversation do you think requires attention now?

[02:10:23] STUDENT:
So, so... Yes.

[02:10:25] BOT:
It seems we've entered a realm of ambiguity! You've responded with "So, so... Yes," but it's unclear what specific aspect of our conversation you're affirming or agreeing to. Could you please clarify which question or point you're trying to affirm? Are you acknowledging the relevance of your paper to Energy readers, or is there another thread in the conversation you'd like to re-emphasize?
