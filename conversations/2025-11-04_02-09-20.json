The paper presents a multi-city, multi-horizon benchmark of machine- and deep-learning HVAC con- trollers under future-weather inputs, jointly evaluatingenergy use,tariff-window peak demand (14:00–20:00), andthermal comfort. The study is controller-agnostic and quantifies grid-relevant impacts (peaks, ramps) alongside standard building metrics, aligning withEnergy’s readership at the building–grid interface. What is new and important.Across five representative climates and three horizons (Historical, Midterm, Longterm), the proposed controllers reduce site EUI by8–11%in cooling-dominant cities and lower tariff-window peak demand by18–30%via pre-cooling. In heating-dominant sites, morning recovery can increase by∼25%, a planning consideration we quantify. Rankings remain stable under a moderate-emissions pathway (RCP4.5 vs. RCP8.5: identical in 57/60 city– horizon cases), indicating pathway-robust guidance. Using representative tariffs (energy$0.08– 0.35/kWh; demand$10–30/kW·month), the Miami reference case converts the reported energy (−6.3 kWh m−2yr−1) and demand-window (−1.8 kW) reductions into roughly$1.0–$3.6 m−2yr−1, illustrating economic significance. Fit forEnergy.The manuscript contributes (i) grid-relevant demand metrics tied to controller policies, (ii) a transparent, reproducible pipeline for future-weather benchmarking, and (iii) deploy- ment guidance that differentiates cooling- vs. heating-dominant sites. We believe it will interest readers working on energy systems integration, building demand flexibility, and planning under climate change. Compliance.This manuscript is original, has not been published previously, and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors approve its submission toEnergy. Data, code, trained weights, and weather files will be released publicly upon acceptance and are available to reviewers on request. Suggested subject areas (non-binding).Energy systems analysis; Demand response and flex- ibility; Energy efficiency in buildings; Future energy scenarios. Thank you for your consideration. I would be happy to address any questions that may arise during review. Sincerely, Hongshan Guo, Ph.D. Assistant Professor Department of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong hongshan@hku.hk 2",

Could you please take a moment to distill your main thesis or central argument in your own words? How would you summarize the core contribution of this paper to our readers?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"
