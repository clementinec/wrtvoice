Energy Future-weather benchmarking of building controllers: energy, peaks and comfort across five climates --Manuscript Draft-- Manuscript Number: Article Type: Full length article Section/Category: Energy in Buildings Keywords: Building energy management; Machine learning control; Thermal comfort prediction; Climate change adaptation; Physics-informed neural networks; EnergyPlus co- simulation Corresponding Author: Hongshan Guo The University of Hong Kong UNITED STATES OF AMERICA First Author: Hongshan Guo Order of Authors: Hongshan Guo Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning controllers for building HVAC systems promise energy savings and improved comfort, but their performance under climate change and across diverse thermal environments remains poorly understood. We address these gaps through comprehensive co-simulation of four control strategies—Reference rule- based control (RBC), PMV-based, Physics-Informed Neural Network Variational Autoencoder (PINN-VAE), and LightGBM—across five climate zones (ASHRAE 2A–6A) and three time horizons (Historical 2001–2020, Midterm 2041–2060, Longterm 2081–2100) under RCP8.5. Using EnergyPlus annual simulations at 15-minute resolution, we evaluate energy use intensity (EUI), peak demand, thermal comfort under three metrics (EnergyPlus discomfort, PMV violations, Adaptive-80% exceedance), load factor, and control ramping. Results reveal fundamental metric-objective mismatches: PINN-VAE and LightGBM, trained on thermal sensation votes, achieve 8–11% EUI savings and 18–30% tariff- window peak reductions in cooling-dominated climates with <10% Adaptive discomfort, yet exhibit 76–91% PMV violations due to adaptive behavior absent in Fanger's model. PMV-based control maintains <20% PMV discomfort but forgoes energy benefits. While predictive controllers achieve 7–11% EUI savings in heating-dominated climates, they create synchronized morning recovery peaks (+25% vs. Reference). Controller rankings remain stable across time horizons despite +1–3% EUI increases from warming. Ramp rate reductions (30–50%) demonstrate grid-friendliness. Metric choice fundamentally alters controller rankings, necessitating transparent multi-objective reporting. We provide climate-specific controller suitability profiles to guide deployment aligned with stakeholder priorities and regional climate trajectories.

The paper presents a multi-city, multi-horizon benchmark of machine- and deep-learning HVAC con- trollers under future-weather inputs, jointly evaluatingenergy use,tariff-window peak demand (14:00–20:00), andthermal comfort. The study is controller-agnostic and quantifies grid-relevant impacts (peaks, ramps) alongside standard building metrics, aligning withEnergy’s readership at the building–grid interface. What is new and important.Across five representative climates and three horizons (Historical, Midterm, Longterm), the proposed controllers reduce site EUI by8–11%in cooling-dominant cities and lower tariff-window peak demand by18–30%via pre-cooling. In heating-dominant sites, morning recovery can increase by∼25%, a planning consideration we quantify. Rankings remain stable under a moderate-emissions pathway (RCP4.5 vs. RCP8.5: identical in 57/60 city– horizon cases), indicating pathway-robust guidance. Using representative tariffs (energy$0.08– 0.35/kWh; demand$10–30/kW·month), the Miami reference case converts the reported energy (−6.3 kWh m−2yr−1) and demand-window (−1.8 kW) reductions into roughly$1.0–$3.6 m−2yr−1, illustrating economic significance. Fit forEnergy.The manuscript contributes (i) grid-relevant demand metrics tied to controller policies, (ii) a transparent, reproducible pipeline for future-weather benchmarking, and

Dear Hongshan Guo,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript, "Future-weather benchmarking of building controllers: energy, peaks and comfort across five climates" for review. I have carefully reviewed the first 500 words.

As we proceed with the evaluation process, I would like to invite you to briefly summarize your main thesis or central argument in your own words. Please take a few sentences to distill the essence of your research question, key findings, and contributions to the field. This will help me better understand the manuscript's significance and relevance.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

[01:36:22] STUDENT:
I was pausing but it doesn't seem like

[01:36:25] BOT:
It seems we've reached a moment of pause! What exactly were you pausing to consider? Was it the complexity of your findings, or perhaps the implications of your results on building energy management practices? Can you clarify what's still unclear for you in this moment?

[01:36:29] STUDENT:
We're reached a moment of pause.

[01:36:31] BOT:
A moment of pause, indeed! It sounds like you might be encountering some uncertainty or hesitation regarding the broader implications of your research. Can you tell me what specifically is causing this pause? Is it related to the potential impact on building energy management practices, or perhaps concerns about how your findings might influence policy decisions or industry standards?

[01:37:11] STUDENT:
I was just not sure if you actually heard what I...

[01:37:13] BOT:
You're wondering whether I fully grasped the nuances of your argument. Let me clarify: you were sharing your thesis, but then seemed to pause as if expecting a specific reaction or confirmation. Can you elaborate on what you were hoping for in that moment? Were you looking for an affirmation of your research's significance or perhaps seeking clarification on how it aligns with existing knowledge in the field?

[01:37:16] STUDENT:
You're wondering whether I fully dressed

[01:37:18] BOT:
It seems we've taken a slight detour from the main conversation. Let's refocus on the essay and its implications.

You mentioned a "moment of pause," but didn't specify what was holding you back. Is it related to the potential benefits or limitations of the controllers discussed in your research? Perhaps there's an assumption or claim that needs further justification?

Can you clarify which specific aspect of your argument is causing this hesitation, and how you envision addressing it in a revised version of your essay?

[01:37:19] STUDENT:
The new us is of your argument.

[01:37:21] BOT:
It seems we've entered a loop. Let's refocus on the original question. You mentioned a "moment of pause," but didn't specify what was holding you back. Is it related to the potential benefits or limitations of the controllers discussed in your research? Can you clarify which specific aspect of your argument is causing this hesitation, and how you envision addressing it in a revised version of your essay?
