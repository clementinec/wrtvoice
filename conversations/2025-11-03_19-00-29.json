  "pdf_context": "Energy Delivery for Occupant Comfort p. 3 Architectural designs have been known to have story-telling more around the form and narratives in comparison to how residents occupy the building. Therefore, as engineers employ environmental technology to enable structural and functional integrity, occupants can sometimes even be considered as the disturbances to maintaining the perfect environmental parameters. Architects tie themselves more to the designs, engineers tie themselves more to the systems, and occupants get the output from the combined work of the two parties while cared by neither as the end user. To address this clear disconnect, I think it’s important that we put a special emphasis on the delivery of comfort towards the occupants during the comfort delivery process. To this end I want to propose /f_ive projects from my past and current research that can feed into future research. The /f_irst project focuses on matching the exergy level of energy sources to the needs of building occupants. This has previously been widely studied as low exergy systems, which deliver energy to households at a lower temperature i.e. requires smaller amount of exergy compared to high exergy systems that operates on sources such as electricity or steam. By developing methods to optimize energy transfer and utilization in low exergy systems, this research aims to provide better occupant comfort and reduce energy waste. This will contribute to the development of sustainable building systems that bene/f_it both building occupants and the environment. The second project aims to recognize the signi/f_icant variations in radiant heat exchange between the human body and surrounding environment caused by the dynamic 3D space created by the movement of occupants. By studying how radiant heat is transferred in this environment, my research will develop design strategies that optimize thermal comfort and energy ef/f_iciency. This will create a more comfortable and sustainable interior environment for building occupants, even in situations where surfaces are in close proximity to the body. Ultimately, this research aims to advance the recognition of radiant heat exchange within the /f_ield of architectural engineering and promote the development of innovative and sustainable systems to ensure proper monitoring and control of these environments.RESEARCH STATEMENT Energy Delivery for Occupant Comfortp. 4The third project aims to acknowledge additional heat-harvesting opportunities through the waste-heat harvesting of cryptocurrency mining facilities for low-temperature district heating. I will investigate innovative and sustainable energy sources, including the repurposing of waste heat generated by cryptocurrency mining facilities to provide energy-ef/f_icient district heating solutions for buildings. The fourth project focuses on monitoring occupant comfort through continuous monitoring using wearable devices. Wearables have gained popularity in recent years, and their applications in the built environment are increasing. By collecting data on occupants’ thermal comfort and physiological responses, this research aims to develop a deeper understanding of how occupants interact with the building environment. Furthermore, the insights gained from these wearable devices could be used to develop personalized health monitoring systems, providing real-time feedback on an individual’s physiological response to their environment. This could lead to the development",
