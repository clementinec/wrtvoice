ESSAY CONTEXT (First 500 words):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
i) Research Context Thermal comfort modeling fundamentally relies on thermal sensation votes - discrete ordinal ratings from -3 (cold) to +3 (hot). Yet current approaches misalign with this ordered structure by treating votes as dis- crete nominal classiﬁcation or continuous regression targets or nominal classiﬁcations. This proposal fun- damentally reexamines the nature of this relationship, ﬂipping the conventional approach from predicting single thermal sensation point estimates to predicting calibrated probability distributions over all thermal sensation vote categories. Unlike nominal classiﬁers or numeric regressors, ordinal models explicitly en- code the ordered nature of TSV via thresholded latent scales (cumulative-link / proportional-odds) [1, 2]. And because building control chooses among actions under uncertainty, we require calibrated class prob- abilities (not just point predictions), so that acceptability, conﬁdence, and tail-risk can be computed with decision-theoretic validity [3, 4, 5]. This proposal does not simply substitute one statistical model for another. It reframes the object of inference itself: from single-point TSV labels to calibrated probability distributions that directly quantify acceptability, conﬁdence, and tail risk for operational control. a) From deterministic indices to data-driven comfort modeling Thermal comfort modeling has evolved through three distinct phases, each addressing limitations of its predecessors while introducing new challenges for building control applications as outlined in Figure 2. Deterministic foundations and ﬁeld limitations. Fanger’s PMV/PPD model [6] established the analyt- ical foundation by balancing metabolic heat production against environmental losses to predict group- average sensation and dissatisfaction. Codiﬁed in ISO 7730 [7] and ASHRAE 55 [8], these indices dominate design compliance and benchmarking. However, decades of ﬁeld application revealed criti- cal fragilities: PMV predictions are sensitive to uncertain inputs—notably mean radiant temperature and metabolic rate—and shortcut practices such as assuming MRT →air temperature introduce systematic errors in comfort indices and control decisions [9, 10]. Adaptive comfort and contextual variation. Large-scale ﬁeld studies by de Dear & Brager [11] and Nicol & Humphreys [12] demonstrated that occupants adapt expectations to outdoor conditions and build- ing operation, producing comfort temperature drifts and broadened acceptability in naturally ventilated buildings. This adaptive perspective, now incorporated into standards as an alternative compliance path, reveals the importance of contextual factors (climate, operation mode, culture) that deterministic models struggle to capture systematically. Machine learning and data quality challenges. The availability of large thermal comfort databases: ASHRAE Global II [13] and Chinese datasets [14]—has catalyzed machine learning studies exploring per- sonalization across climates and building types [15, 16]. However, data heterogeneity in instrumentation and protocols, missing personal variables, and systematic measurement shortcuts (e.g., MRT assumptions) create generalization challenges where naive ML may overﬁt artifacts rather than genuine physiological responses [9, 17]. Most ML studies report top-1 accuracy or MSE, but control-relevant use hinges on well-calibrated probabilities and order-aware evaluation, not nominal accuracy alone [3, 4]. b) Current challenges in comfort modeling and control Three fundamental challenges limit the application of thermal comfort models to building control: mea- surement heterogeneity, missing contextual stratiﬁcation, and the mismatch between ordinal sensation scales and control requirements. We saw these challenges ﬁrst-hand

Dear student,

I appreciate the time and effort you've invested in submitting your essay. I'm excited to review it! To get us started, could you please distill your main thesis into a concise statement that captures the central argument or claim you're making? This will help me understand the underlying ideas and provide targeted feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

[02:25:38] STUDENT:
Nothing?

[02:25:42] BOT:
Let's clarify what we mean by "nothing." You've written an entire essay, so there must be some key idea or argument you're trying to convey. Could you please take a step back and summarize the main point you're making about thermal comfort modeling? What is it that you hope readers will understand or agree with as a result of reading your essay?

(Note: I'm not looking for a simple "yes" or "no," but rather a brief statement that distills the essence of your argument. This will help us get started on exploring the ideas and arguments presented in your essay.)

[02:25:50] STUDENT:
No, like I provided a respond you did not

[02:25:52] BOT:
It seems we're getting off to a bit of a confusing start. Let's take a step back and try again.

You mentioned earlier that your essay makes some claims about thermal comfort modeling, but when asked to summarize the main point, you said "nothing." I'm having trouble understanding what specific idea or argument you're trying to convey.

Can you please clarify: What is it about the current state of thermal comfort modeling that you're trying to change or improve? What specific insight or innovation do you believe your essay brings to this field?

[02:25:53] STUDENT:
really hear it.

[02:25:55] BOT:
I think we may be getting stuck. You said "really hear it," but I'm still not sure what the main point of your essay is. Could you try again to tell me, in your own words, what specific claim or argument you're making about thermal comfort modeling?

Let's break it down: What do you think is the biggest limitation or challenge with current approaches to thermal comfort modeling?
