We generate scenario-conditioned Actual Meteorological Years (sAMYs) for 2025–2095 by locking CORDEX daily temperature (and solar) signals while restoring observed diurnal shape and multivariate covariance from ISD records; solar is harmonized via an ERA5 →NSRDB calibration. We then freeze present-day capacities and controls of three ASHRAE/DOE prototypes (Medium Office, Stand-alone Retail, Mid-rise Apartment) in four cities (Miami, Los Angeles, Toronto, Montreal) and stress them year-by-year. Validation shows the sAMYs match CORDEX daily warming and preserve event persistence while retaining realistic hourly structure. Results reveal that peak demand increases faster than annual energy, with the largest growth in hot- humid climates and in retail; offices in cool-humid climates show declining winter peaks and modest energy increases. Comfort exposure trends depend on the lens: setpoint-based unmet changes little, PMV highlights latent limitations (retail, Miami/LA), and adaptive captures expectation-driven exposure (apartments late-century). System diagnostics from EnergyPlus logs indicate a shift from controller-struggle to capacity-saturated operation in late decades, consistent with hours at coil/SAT caps. A severity–frequency map and a dry-bulb ×dew-point driver analysis attribute failures to sensible vs latent mechanisms, informing targeted adaptations (dehumidification, modest capacity bump, SAT reset/night purge). The sAMY corpus, code and metrics are released to support reproducible, time- resolved resilience assessments. Keywords: 1. Introduction Hot extremes and multi-day heatwaves are increasing in frequency, intensity, and per- sistence as the planet warms; even small increments in global mean temperature yield dis- cernible increases in hot-extreme occurrence and severity [1, 2]. For building resilience, the critical question is not performance under an average future slice, but whena design fails under plausible future sequences . We learn sub-daily structure from in-situ station observations via NOAA’s Integrated Surface Database (ISD) [3, 4]. Because the backbone network (ASOS/AWOS) is primarily at airports embedded in urban fabrics, these data offer city-proximal exposure compared with coarse reanalyses [5, 6]. Representativeness and siting follow the Local Climate Zones framework and canonical urban heat-island physics [7, 8]. Future daily-scale signals come from CORDEX, linked to CMIP and designed for im- pacts/adaptation [9, 10]. We adopt these day-by-day signals so that trends and event timing (e.g., hot-spell onset/persistence) are scenario-faithful.

Comparative analyses and assessments show material discrepancies versus multi-year actual weather (AWY/AMY) across climates and typologies [14, 15, 16]. Recent community resources (IEA EBC Annex

Dear Hongshan,

Thank you for sharing your thoughtful essay on "Freeze-then-Stress: Time-Resolved Building Resilience through the 21st Century with Scenario-Conditioned Weather". I'm excited to engage with your ideas.

As we dive deeper into the nuances of climate resilience, I'd like to understand the core of your argument. In your own words, could you please explain what you believe is the central contribution or main thesis of this essay? What specific insights do you hope readers will take away from your analysis?

[18:47:26] STUDENT:
I don't know if actually you are listening or not, but...

[18:47:30] BOT:
I am most definitely listening! However, it seems we've taken a slight detour. Let's get back on track.

You initially mentioned the main thesis of your essay. Could you revisit that? What exactly do you think is the central contribution or main argument of "Freeze-then-Stress"?

[18:47:32] STUDENT:
I'm concerned.

[18:47:34] BOT:
I understand that you're feeling concerned, but let's break it down together. You initially wanted to explain the core of your argument, and now you seem uncertain. Can you tell me specifically what aspect of your essay is making you feel this way? Is it related to a particular claim or finding in the analysis?
