- 1 - 251/1025 THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG Proposed Reform of PhD and MPhil Programmes Introduction This paper presents the University’s proposed reform of its research postgraduate (RPg) programmes , designed to enhance academic rigor, harmonize expectations across disciplines , and align with global best practices in doctoral education. By reimagining admissions process , supervisory structure , pedagogical training, candidacy advancement protocol , funding arra ngement and governance framework , the reform seek s to foster pedagogical competence, timely completion rates, and world -class research outcomes . Drawing inspiration from leading U .S. institutions such as Princeton University , the University of Michigan, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles , the University of Southern California , and Northwestern University , the revisions emphasize structured mentorship, transparent milestones, and accoun tability. Governance Structur e and Oversight 2. A cornerstone of this reform is the strategic division of management oversight to optimize leadership focus : • Pre-candidacy: all activities — including admissions -related matters , coursework and training , supervisory arrangement, and qualifying examination — fall under the authority of the Vice - President and Pro -Vice -Chancellor (Teaching & Learning) (VP/T&L). • Candidacy: after advancement to candidacy, oversight of thesis research and thesis examination transition to the Vice -President and Pro -Vice -Chancellor (Research) (VP/R) . This phased model ensures focused leadership: VP/T&L prioritizes foundational training and candidacy readiness, while VP/R drives advanced research outcomes. Transitioning to a PhD -focused Research Postgraduate Mode l 3. The University currently offers RPg degree programmes at both the Master’s and the Doctoral level s in all faculties and schools/departments. In the past ten years, the number of students enrol led in the Master of Philosophy (MPhil) programme has declined from 19% of the total RPg student population in 201 4/15 to 9% in 202 3/24. Among the 8,624 applications received in the 202 4/25 academic year, there were 7,465 applications (8 7%) for admission to the PhD programme and only 1,159 applications (13%) for MPhil . The limited demand shows that m ost students interested in pursuing an RPg degree prefer to enter directly into the doctoral programme. 4. To optimise resource utilisation , maintain high standards of research excellence, and align with international best practices , it is proposed that new students be admitted exclusively to the PhD programme . The MPhil degree will serve as an exit qualification for PhD students who either do not pass the qualifying examination at their second attempt or, for various reasons, choose to transfer from the PhD programme prior to completion . - 2 - Admissions Reform: Cohort -based Intake and Supervisor Appointment 5. To uphold high admission standard s and facilitate structured programme delivery, cohort - based admission is recommended in place of the current year-round admission cycle. Admission decisions will be based primarily on the academic merit of applicants. A supervisor will be appointed at the conclusion of Year 1.

[18:38:47] STUDENT:
Is it a good reform?

[18:38:50] BOT:
A concise opening salvo! You've posed a fundamental question, but let's delve deeper. What do you mean by "good"? Are you referring to the reform's potential benefits for students, the University's efficiency, or something else entirely? Please clarify what aspects of the proposed reform you consider essential in determining its goodness.

[18:39:02] STUDENT:
I guess it's mostly about the students.

A nuanced admission! You acknowledge that the proposed reform centers around the students. That's a great starting point for further exploration. Can you elaborate on what specifically concerns or benefits students in this reform? Are there particular aspects, such as the phased governance structure, supervisor appointments, or cohort-based intake, that you think hold significant implications for student outcomes or experiences?

[18:39:04] STUDENT:
not the teachers.

[18:39:06] BOT:
A concise yet intriguing response! You've asserted that the proposed reform doesn't seem to focus on the teachers. That's an interesting claim, given that the reform touches upon aspects like pedagogical training and governance structures. Can you explain what you mean by "not the teachers"? Are there specific ways in which the reform appears to neglect or overlook the needs of academic staff?
