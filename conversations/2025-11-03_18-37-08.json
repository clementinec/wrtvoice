  "pdf_context": "i) Research Context Thermal comfort modeling fundamentally relies on thermal sensation votes - discrete ordinal ratings from -3 (cold) to +3 (hot). Yet current approaches misalign with this ordered structure by treating votes as dis- crete nominal classiﬁcation or continuous regression targets or nominal classiﬁcations. This proposal fun- damentally reexamines the nature of this relationship, ﬂipping the conventional approach from predicting single thermal sensation point estimates to predicting calibrated probability distributions over all thermal sensation vote categories. Unlike nominal classiﬁers or numeric regressors, ordinal models explicitly en- code the ordered nature of TSV via thresholded latent scales (cumulative-link / proportional-odds) [1, 2]. And because building control chooses among actions under uncertainty, we require calibrated class prob- abilities (not just point predictions), so that acceptability, conﬁdence, and tail-risk can be computed with decision-theoretic validity [3, 4, 5]. This proposal does not simply substitute one statistical model for another. It reframes the object of inference itself: from single-point TSV labels to calibrated probability distributions that directly quantify acceptability, conﬁdence, and tail risk for operational control. a) From deterministic indices to data-driven comfort modeling Thermal comfort modeling has evolved through three distinct phases, each addressing limitations of its predecessors while introducing new challenges for building control applications as outlined in Figure 2. Deterministic foundations and ﬁeld limitations. Fanger’s PMV/PPD model [6] established the analyt- ical foundation by balancing metabolic heat production against environmental losses to predict group- average sensation and dissatisfaction. Codiﬁed in ISO 7730 [7] and ASHRAE 55 [8], these indices dominate design compliance and benchmarking. However, decades of ﬁeld application revealed criti- cal fragilities: PMV predictions are sensitive to uncertain inputs—notably mean radiant temperature and metabolic rate—and shortcut practices such as assuming MRT →air temperature introduce systematic errors in comfort indices and control decisions [9, 10]. Adaptive comfort and contextual variation. Large-scale ﬁeld studies by de Dear & Brager [11] and Nicol & Humphreys [12] demonstrated that occupants adapt expectations to outdoor conditions and build- ing operation, producing comfort temperature drifts and broadened acceptability in naturally ventilated buildings. This adaptive perspective, now incorporated into standards as an alternative compliance path, reveals the importance of contextual factors (climate, operation mode, culture) that deterministic models struggle to capture systematically. Machine learning and data quality challenges. The availability of large thermal comfort databases: ASHRAE Global II [13] and Chinese datasets [14]—has catalyzed machine learning studies exploring per- sonalization across climates and building types [15, 16]. However, data heterogeneity in instrumentation and protocols, missing personal variables, and systematic measurement shortcuts (e.g., MRT assumptions) create generalization challenges where naive ML may overﬁt artifacts rather than genuine physiological responses [9, 17]. Most ML studies report top-1 accuracy or MSE, but control-relevant use hinges on well-calibrated probabilities and order-aware evaluation, not nominal accuracy alone [3, 4]. b) Current challenges in comfort modeling and control Three fundamental challenges limit the application of thermal comfort models to building control: mea- surement heterogeneity, missing contextual stratiﬁcation, and the mismatch between ordinal sensation scales and control requirements. We saw these challenges ﬁrst-hand",
