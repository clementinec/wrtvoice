We generate scenario-conditioned Actual Meteorological Years (sAMYs) for 2025–2095 by locking CORDEX daily temperature (and solar) signals while restoring observed diurnal shape and multivariate covariance from ISD records; solar is harmonized via an ERA5 →NSRDB calibration. We then freeze present-day capacities and controls of three ASHRAE/DOE prototypes (Medium Office, Stand-alone Retail, Mid-rise Apartment) in four cities (Miami, Los Angeles, Toronto, Montreal) and stress them year-by-year. Validation shows the sAMYs match CORDEX daily warming and preserve event persistence while retaining realistic hourly structure. Results reveal that peak demand increases faster than annual energy, with the largest growth in hot- humid climates and in retail; offices in cool-humid climates show declining winter peaks and modest energy increases. Comfort exposure trends depend on the lens: setpoint-based unmet changes little, PMV highlights latent limitations (retail, Miami/LA), and adaptive captures expectation-driven exposure (apartments late-century). System diagnostics from EnergyPlus logs indicate a shift from controller-struggle to capacity-saturated operation in late decades, consistent with hours at coil/SAT caps. A severity–frequency map and a dry-bulb ×dew-point driver analysis attribute failures to sensible vs latent mechanisms, informing targeted adaptations (dehumidification, modest capacity bump, SAT reset/night purge). The sAMY corpus, code and metrics are released to support reproducible, time- resolved resilience assessments. Keywords: 1. Introduction Hot extremes and multi-day heatwaves are increasing in frequency, intensity, and per- sistence as the planet warms; even small increments in global mean temperature yield dis- cernible increases in hot-extreme occurrence and severity [1, 2]. For building resilience, the critical question is not performance under an average future slice, but whena design fails under plausible future sequences . We learn sub-daily structure from in-situ station observations via NOAA’s Integrated Surface Database (ISD) [3, 4]. Because the backbone network (ASOS/AWOS) is primarily at airports embedded in urban fabrics, these data offer city-proximal exposure compared with coarse reanalyses [5, 6]. Representativeness and siting follow the Local Climate Zones framework and canonical urban heat-island physics [7, 8]. Future daily-scale signals come from CORDEX, linked to CMIP and designed for im- pacts/adaptation [9, 10]. We adopt these day-by-day signals so that trends and event timing (e.g., hot-spell onset/persistence) are scenario-faithful.

Comparative analyses and assessments show material discrepancies versus multi-year actual weather (AWY/AMY) across climates and typologies [14, 15, 16]. Recent community resources (IEA EBC Annex",

I'm eager to engage with your ideas.\n\nTo clarify the core of your argument, could you please explain in your own words what you see as the main thesis or central claim of this work? What specific contribution do you aim to make to our understanding of building resilience in the face of climate change?"

Can you elaborate on what aspects of this research make it stand out as particularly valuable?"

Or is there something specific about the outcomes or implications of this study that make it particularly impactful?\n\nIn other words, could you clarify how the novelty of your approach translates into actual value or contributions for building resilience in the face of climate change?"
