Applied Energy Evaluating Future Building Resilience: A Multi-City, Multi-Horizon Framework for Grid and Comfort Outcomes Hongshan Guo --Manuscript Draft-- Manuscript Number: Article Type: Research Paper Keywords: Building energy management; Machine learning control; Thermal comfort prediction; Climate change adaptation; Physics-informed neural networks; EnergyPlus co- simulation Corresponding Author: Hongshan Guo The University of Hong Kong UNITED STATES First Author: Hongshan Guo Order of Authors: Hongshan Guo Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning controllers for building HVAC systems promise simultaneous energy savings and improved occupant comfort, but their performance under climate change and across diverse thermal environments remains poorly understood. Existing evaluations typically focus on single metrics (energy or comfort) in isolated climates, neglecting metric interdependencies, seasonal mechanisms, and non-stationary climate forcing. We address these gaps through comprehensive co- simulation of four control strategies—Reference rule-based control (RBC), PMV-based, Physics-Informed Neural Network Variational Autoencoder (PINN-VAE), and LightGBM—across five climate zones (ASHRAE 2A–6A: Miami, Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, Brussels, Stockholm) and three time horizons (Historical 2001–2020, Midterm 2041–2060, Longterm 2081–2100) under RCP8.5 climate scenarios. Using EnergyPlus annual simulations at 15-minute resolution, we evaluate eight performance dimensions: total energy use intensity (EUI), peak demand, thermal comfortunder three metrics (EnergyPlus 24/7 discomfort, PMV violations, Adaptive-80% exceedance), load factor, and control ramping. Results reveal fundamental metric-objective mismatches: PINN-VAE and LightGBM, trained on occupant-reported thermal sensation votes (TSV), achieve 8–11% EUI savings and 18–30% tariff-window peak reductions in cooling-dominated climates (zones 2A–3B) with <10% Adaptive discomfort, yet exhibit 76–91% PMV violations due to adaptive behavior absent in Fanger’s steady-state model. Conversely, PMV-based control maintains <20% PMV discomfort but forgoes energy benefits (<2% savings). Critically, while predictive controllers achieve 7–11% EUI savings even in heating-dominated climates (zone 6A) via substantial heating reductions, they create synchronized morning recovery peaks (+25% vs. Reference), posing grid management challenges despite energy benefits. Controller rankings remain stable across time horizons despite +1–3% EUI increases from climate change, indicating robustness to mid-century warming. Comfort-efficiency trade-off analysis identifies Pareto-optimal deployment strategies: LightGBM for maximum energy/cost reduction in warm climates, PINN-VAE for balanced performance, PMV for comfort- critical applications. Ramp rate reductions (30–50% vs. Reference in cooling climates)demonstrate grid-friendliness, though fleet-scale synchronization risks require aggregator-level coordination. We provide climate-specific controller suitability profiles and multi-metric evaluation protocols to guide building operators, policymakers, and researchers in selecting ML/DL strategies aligned with stakeholder priorities and regional climate trajectories. Our findings underscore that metric choice fundamentally alters controller rankings, necessitating transparent multi-objective reporting for equitable performance assessment.

CONVERSATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[02:19:02] BOT:
Here's a brief welcoming message:

"Dear Hongshan, 

Thank you for submitting your thought-provoking essay on evaluating future building resilience through multi-city and multi-horizon frameworks. I've reviewed the first 500 words and am eager to engage with your ideas.

Can you please explain in your own words what you believe is the main thesis or central argument of your paper? What key insights do you hope readers will take away from your research?"

[02:19:32] STUDENT:
Hello?

[02:19:35] BOT:
Noted. You've acknowledged my message, but I'd like to clarify what sparked our conversation in the first place. Could you tell me again what you believe is the main thesis or central argument of your essay? What specific point do you hope readers will grasp from your research on evaluating future building resilience?

[02:19:47] STUDENT:
But you have the paper, why are you asking that?

[02:19:49] BOT:
A valid question, indeed! I'm not trying to rehash what's already written. Rather, I'd like to ensure we're on the same page about the core argument and key takeaways. Can you tell me what specifically resonates with your research, and what particular point do you hope readers will retain as a primary insight?

[02:20:03] STUDENT:
That's such a framework, doesn't exist.

[02:20:05] BOT:
You think the framework we're discussing isn't currently in use? Can you clarify what you mean by "such a framework"? Are you suggesting that no one is evaluating future building resilience through multi-city and multi-horizon frameworks like the one presented in your paper?

In other words, are you implying that your research is proposing something entirely new, or rather, building upon existing approaches with some unique twists?

[02:20:12] STUDENT:
The framework that I presented in my paper.

[02:20:14] BOT:
You've clarified that the framework you're referring to is indeed the one presented in your paper. So, let me ask this: If we assume that this framework is not entirely new, but rather a refinement or extension of existing approaches, how does your research contribute to our understanding of building resilience in a way that wasn't possible before?

[02:20:26] STUDENT:
That combines different categories.

[02:20:27] BOT:
You think the framework presented in your paper combines different categories in a unique way. Can you specify which categories are being combined and how this synthesis leads to new insights or improvements over existing methods? What particular strengths or advantages does this integration bring to the evaluation of building resilience?

[02:20:28] STUDENT:
the strength, we've got climate, we've got

[02:20:31] BOT:
You're getting at the heart of the framework's novelty. Can you clarify what specifically makes this integration of climate and other factors a "strength"? Is it that your approach allows for more comprehensive evaluations across different climates and horizons? Or perhaps it's that this synthesis enables a deeper understanding of how building resilience interacts with various performance dimensions, such as energy use intensity and thermal comfort?

What I'm trying to get at is: what unique benefits does this combined framework offer over existing methods or frameworks that might be less comprehensive in their approach?

[02:20:32] STUDENT:
for it.

[02:20:34] BOT:
It seems like you're getting close to articulating the strengths of your framework, but we've hit a snag. You mentioned "it," but I'm not quite sure what "it" refers to. Could you clarify what specific aspect or benefit of your combined framework is being pointed to by "it"? What unique advantage does this integration bring that wasn't possible with existing methods?

[02:21:16] STUDENT:
I said comfort

[02:21:18] BOT:
You've mentioned "comfort" as a key aspect of the framework. Can you explain how your approach to evaluating thermal comfort, particularly through metrics like PMV violations and Adaptive-80% exceedance, contributes to the overall assessment of building resilience? How does this evaluation method differ from or improve upon existing methods for assessing thermal comfort in buildings?

[02:21:18] STUDENT:
climate as well as.

[02:21:21] BOT:
You're getting closer to articulating the framework's strengths, but we've hit another snag. "Climate as well as" is a bit too vague for me. Can you specify what you mean by that phrase? Are you suggesting that your approach considers both climate factors and other performance dimensions (like energy use intensity) simultaneously? If so, how does this simultaneous consideration enhance the overall assessment of building resilience compared to existing methods that might focus on one aspect or the other?
