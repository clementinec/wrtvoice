We address these gaps through comprehensive co-simulation of four control strategies—Reference rule- based control (RBC), PMV-based, Physics-Informed Neural Network Variational Autoencoder (PINN-VAE), and LightGBM—across five climate zones (ASHRAE 2A–6A) and three time horizons (Historical 2001–2020, Midterm 2041–2060, Longterm 2081–2100) under RCP8.5. Using EnergyPlus annual simulations at 15-minute resolution, we evaluate energy use intensity (EUI), peak demand, thermal comfort under three metrics (EnergyPlus discomfort, PMV violations, Adaptive-80% exceedance), load factor, and control ramping. Results reveal fundamental metric-objective mismatches: PINN-VAE and LightGBM, trained on thermal sensation votes, achieve 8–11% EUI savings and 18–30% tariff- window peak reductions in cooling-dominated climates with <10% Adaptive discomfort, yet exhibit 76–91% PMV violations due to adaptive behavior absent in Fanger's model. PMV-based control maintains <20% PMV discomfort but forgoes energy benefits. While predictive controllers achieve 7–11% EUI savings in heating-dominated climates, they create synchronized morning recovery peaks (+25% vs. Reference). Controller rankings remain stable across time horizons despite +1–3% EUI increases from warming. Ramp rate reductions (30–50%) demonstrate grid-friendliness. Metric choice fundamentally alters controller rankings, necessitating transparent multi-objective reporting. We provide climate-specific controller suitability profiles to guide deployment aligned with stakeholder priorities and regional climate trajectories.

The paper presents a multi-city, multi-horizon benchmark of machine- and deep-learning HVAC con- trollers under future-weather inputs, jointly evaluatingenergy use,tariff-window peak demand (14:00–20:00), andthermal comfort. The study is controller-agnostic and quantifies grid-relevant impacts (peaks, ramps) alongside standard building metrics, aligning withEnergy’s readership at the building–grid interface. What is new and important.Across five representative climates and three horizons (Historical, Midterm, Longterm), the proposed controllers reduce site EUI by8–11%in cooling-dominant cities and lower tariff-window peak demand by18–30%via pre-cooling. In heating-dominant sites, morning recovery can increase by∼25%, a planning consideration we quantify. Rankings remain stable under a moderate-emissions pathway (RCP4.5 vs. RCP8.5: identical in 57/60 city– horizon cases), indicating pathway-robust guidance. Using representative tariffs (energy$0.08– 0.35/kWh; demand$10–30/kW·month), the Miami reference case converts the reported energy (−6.3 kWh m−2yr−1) and demand-window (−1.8 kW) reductions into roughly$1.0–$3.6 m−2yr−1, illustrating economic significance. Fit forEnergy.The manuscript contributes (i) grid-relevant demand metrics tied to controller policies, (ii) a transparent, reproducible pipeline for future-weather benchmarking, and",
